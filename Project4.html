              <h5>Thinking, Fast and Slow: How Response Times Can Predict Cognitive Decline and (Bad) Financial Decision-Making at Older Ages
              </h5>
              <p align="justify"> 
This study investigates the potential of response times (RT) as a predictor of cognitive decline, leveraging pre-
viously untapped data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). Recorded automat-
ically during Computer-Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI), RTs offer a unique opportunity to study cognitive and
decision-making processes without added respondent burden. We first validate RTs as meaningful predictors of cog-
nitive decline, building on Sanders et al. (2025). Slower RTs—recorded automatically during standard cognitive
modules—are strongly associated with lower baseline cognitive scores and greater subsequent decline, even after
controlling for age, gender, and baseline cognition. RTs also predict deterioration across a range of health outcomes,
including frailty, mental health, and mortality, underscoring their potential as early indicators of physiological aging.
We then examine the predictive content of RTs for financial outcomes. Slower RTs are associated with subse-
quent wealth losses, above and beyond what is captured by standard cognitive measures and interviewer fixed effects.
Replicating the findings of Mazzonna and Peracchi (2024) in a European context, we show that individuals who ex-
perience cognitive decline without being aware of it are particularly vulnerable to wealth decumulation. Importantly,
RTs remain predictive of wealth losses even when cognitive decline and (un)awareness are accounted for, and they
are strongly associated with being unaware of one’s own cognitive deterioration. This suggests that RTs can help
identify individuals at risk of poor financial decision-making due to undiagnosed cognitive impairment. Finally, we
document heterogeneity by gender, with stronger associations observed among male financial respondents.
Taken together, our findings demonstrate that response times—routinely collected but often ignored—contain rich
information about both cognitive and financial vulnerability at older ages</p>
