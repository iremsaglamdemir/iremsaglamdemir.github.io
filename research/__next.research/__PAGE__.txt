During the period 1900-1920, approximately 1,600 counties in the United States voluntarily went dry, while an almost equal number were forced to comply with state-level prohibitions. I argue that being forced to become dry fostered a long-lasting latent culture of adaptation and informal entrepreneurship. Using county-level data from 2010–2023, I find that exposure to forced prohibition is associated with a surge in new business applications in the aftermath of the COVID-19 shock. This effect appears to be more pronounced in areas with low remote-work feasibility and stronger anti-prohibition sentiment. My results suggest that informal entrepreneurial norms rooted in the resistance to prohibition had an enduring impact on economic adaptability and entrepreneurship."}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex gap-4 flex-wrap","children":["$","a",null,{"href":"/jmp.pdf","className":"text-sm font-semibold text-accent hover:underline","children":"PDF"}]}]]}],["$","div","2",{"className":"rounded-lg p-8 shadow-sm border bg-card border-border","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-start justify-between mb-3 gap-4","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"serif text-2xl font-bold text-foreground flex-1","children":"Natural Disasters, Media Narratives, and Electoral Behavior: Evidence from the 2023 Turkish Earthquake"}],"$undefined"]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-6"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6 p-4 bg-secondary/50 rounded border border-border","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm font-semibold text-foreground mb-3","children":"Abstract:"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-base text-foreground leading-relaxed","children":"Natural disasters can reshape electoral outcomes by altering public perceptions and information flows.

The frontier conditions that shaped early American settlement are known to foster self-reliance, inventiveness, and rugged individualism—traits that may influence labor supply decisions in the face of uncertainty. Using the Total Frontier Experience (TFE) measure and modern census data on job quits and new business applications, I show that counties with greater historical frontier exposure experienced significantly higher rates of both voluntary quitting and self-employment following the COVID-19 shock. These patterns reflect the broader labor market shifts often characterized as the Great Resignation. The results are robust to controls for pandemic severity, resistance to vaccine mandates, and variation in government transfers."}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex gap-4 flex-wrap","children":["$","a",null,{"href":"/culture_paper.pdf","className":"text-sm font-semibold text-accent hover:underline","children":"PDF"}]}]]}]
