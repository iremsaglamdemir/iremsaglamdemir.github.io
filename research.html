      </a>
      <div class="articles">
        This study investigates the effects of influenza vaccination on labor market outcomes in the United States. 
        I exploit random variation in the match between the viruses present in the vaccine and those in circulation to
        estimate the impact of influenza vaccination on employment and wages. The findings indicate a positive impact 
        of vaccination on labor market outcomes in both high- and low-contact non-tradable sectors. However, this impact is small in 
        tradable sectors. The results suggest that two mechanisms behind this relationship are an increase in labor productivity in 
        high-contact sectors and a surge in aggregate demand driven by higher labor income of workers in directly affected sectors. 
        These findings provide new evidence that aggregate supply shocks in directly 
        affected sectors may cause demand fluctuations in sectors that are not directly affected.

        Ban the Box (BTB) laws delay criminal background checks until the later stages of the hiring process. 
        This study provides new evidence that BTB laws that apply to both private and public employers have negative 
        spillover effects beyond labor market outcomes. Drawing on data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), 
        I investigate the impact of BTB laws on drug-related mortality. Two years after adoption, BTB laws are associated 
        with more than a 35 percent increase in drug-related mortality among Black and Hispanic men. The main mechanism appears 
        to be diminished labor opportunities. BTB adoption reduces wages and the probability of employment among Black and Hispanic men.

      </a>
      <div class="articles">
        To what extent does representation in mass media content influence gender-related perceptions of children and their later-life achievements? 
        This study examines how childhood exposure to female-led superhero animated series shapes educational choices and gender stereotypes. 
        We leverage two sources of variation: the signal coverage of the TV channel broadcasting these cartoons across areas in Ukraine in the early 2000s, 
        and the duration of exposure to these cartoons during childhood. We find that girls who had access to cartoons with strong female leads have higher educational attainments. 
        They are also more likely to pursue STEM subjects, and have more internal locus of control. 
        Additionally, for both sexes, we have evidence of a decline in traditional gender stereotypes.

        <h6 class="text-muted mb-2"><em>with Yarine Fawaz and Pedro Mira</em></h6>
      </a>
      <div class="articles">
        This study investigates the potential of response times (RT) as a predictor of cognitive decline, leveraging previously untapped data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). 
        Recorded automatically during Computer-Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI), RTs offer a unique opportunity to study cognitive and decision-making processes without added respondent burden. 
        We first validate RTs as meaningful predictors of cognitive decline, building on Sanders et al. (2025). Slower RTs—recorded automatically during standard cognitive modules—are strongly associated with lower baseline cognitive scores and greater subsequent decline, even after controlling for age, gender, and baseline cognition. 
        RTs also predict deterioration across a range of health outcomes, including frailty, mental health, and mortality, underscoring their potential as early indicators of physiological aging.
        We then examine the predictive content of RTs for financial outcomes. Slower RTs are associated with subsequent wealth losses, above and beyond what is captured by standard cognitive measures and interviewer fixed effects. 
        Replicating the findings of Mazzonna and Peracchi (2024) in a European context, we show that individuals who experience cognitive decline without being aware of it are particularly vulnerable to wealth decumulation. 
        Importantly, RTs remain predictive of wealth losses even when cognitive decline and (un)awareness are accounted for, and they are strongly associated with being unaware of one’s own cognitive deterioration. 
        This suggests that RTs can help identify individuals at risk of poor financial decision-making due to undiagnosed cognitive impairment. 
        Finally, we document heterogeneity by gender, with stronger associations observed among male financial respondents. 
        Taken together, our findings demonstrate that response times—routinely collected but often ignored—contain rich information about both cognitive and financial vulnerability at older ages.
