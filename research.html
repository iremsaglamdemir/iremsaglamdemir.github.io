            </h5>
          </a>
          <div class="articles">
            This paper examines whether early 20th century state-level prohibitions on the sale and manufacture of
            alcohol influenced entrepreneurial responses to the COVID-19 crisis. During the period 1900-1920,
            approximately 1,600 counties in the United States voluntarily went dry (i.e., they prohibited the sale and
            manufacture of alcohol through local referenda or local ordinances), while an almost equal number of
            counties were forced to comply with state-level prohibitions. I argue that being forced to become dry
            fostered a long-lasting latent culture of adaptation and informal entrepreneurship. Using county-level data
            from 2010–2023, I find that exposure to forced prohibition is associated with a surge in new business
            applications in the aftermath of the COVID-19 shock. This effect appears to be more pronounced in areas
            with low remote-work feasibility and stronger anti-prohibition sentiment as, for instance, measured by
            references to bootlegging and speakeasys in historical newspaper accounts and anti-prohibition party vote
            shares. My results suggest that informal entrepreneurial norms rooted in the resistance to prohibition had
            an enduring impact on economic adaptability and entrepreneurship.

          </a>
          <div class="articles">
            Natural disasters can reshape electoral outcomes by altering public perceptions and information flows. This study examines Turkey’s catastrophic earthquake of February 2023 using an event-study framework and spatial variation in exposure. Estimates indicate that disaster exposed areas experienced an immediate 7 percentage-point increase in the incumbent’s vote share in the May 2023 elections, despite widespread criticism of the disaster response. This temporary rise appears to be linked to short-term rally-around-the-flag dynamics and media narratives emphasizing unity, while aid distribution does not account for the observed increase. The results contribute to the broader literature on crisis response, information environments, and voting behavior in highly centralized political systems.

          </a>
          <div class="articles">
            Can cultural orientation be at the root of new labor and entrepreneurial trends triggered by the COVID-19 shock in the U.S.? The frontier conditions that shaped early American settlement are known to foster self-reliance, inventiveness, and rugged individualism—traits that may influence labor supply decisions in the face of uncertainty. Using the Total Frontier Experience (TFE) measure developed by Bazzi et al. (2020) and modern census data on job quits and new business applications, I show that counties with greater historical frontier exposure experienced significantly higher rates of both voluntary quitting and self-employment following the COVID-19 shock. These patterns reflect the broader labor market shifts often characterized as the Great Resignation. The results are robust to controls for pandemic severity, resistance to vaccine mandates, and variation in government transfers. By linking frontier-driven cultural traits to modern labor market behavior, this paper adds a labor supply dimension to the literature on cultural persistence and offers a cultural explanation for regional variation in labor market dynamics during the pandemic recovery.

          <div class="articles">
            This project examines how exposure to warfare during childhood shapes long-run gender norms and attitudes. 
            I compile novel historical datasets on WWII exposure, linked with contemporary survey data on gender attitudes and behaviors. 
            Preliminary analysis suggests that early-life exposure to war correlates with persistent differences in gender role attitudes.
            Ongoing work focuses on refining exposure measures and testing mechanisms. The historical dataset will be available upon completion of the project.
